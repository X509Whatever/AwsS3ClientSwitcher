# AwsS3ClientSwitcher
An interim AWS S3 client wrapper package providing an upgrade path from NetFx to NetStd versions of Aws S3 Sdl/Client.
The purpose of this repository is to be able to use HttpClient in the background instead of an HttpWebRequest (and its corresponding problems plus the fact of having to touch the SPM).
